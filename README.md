# Kaggle-Bird-CLEF-2025

## BirdCLEF+ 2025 - Bronze Medal Solution

This repository contains the code and experiments used for participating in the [BirdCLEF 2025](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/birdclef-2025) competition hosted on Kaggle. The competition challenged participants to build robust models for identifying bird species from audio recordings collected in diverse environments of El Silencio Natural Reserve, Colombia.

## Competition Overview

- **Goal**: Detect bird calls from long-duration audio recordings using machine learning.
- **Hosted By**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- **Challenge Type**: Multi-label classification using spectrograms and raw audio.
- **Evaluation Metric**: ROC-AUC Score.

**Statistics:**
- 2,569 Participants  
- 2,025 Teams  
- 70,674 Submissions  
- Ranked **186th** out of **2,025 team entries**  
- Achieved **0.893 ROC-AUC Score**  


## Models & Approach

This solution primarily used an **ensemble of advanced CNN-based architectures**, along with audio-specific augmentations and pooling strategies:

### Core Models Used:
- **EfficientNet-B0 & B3**
- **ResNet34** (customized for spectrograms)
- **SE-ResNeXt50** (fine-tuned with PANN pre-trained weights)
- **Conformer** (for temporal modeling)

### Technical Highlights:
- Used **Mel spectrograms** and **Log-mel spectrograms** with and without noise.
- Integrated **multi-head self-attention pooling** and **GeM pooling** layers.
- Employed **Focal Loss** to handle class imbalance.
- Optimized using **AdamW** with learning rate warm-up and cosine annealing.
- **5-fold Stratified Cross-Validation** with test-time augmentation.
- **SpecAugment** and **mixup** techniques applied to augment data diversity.

## Final Result

Our final submission scored **0.893 ROC-AUC**, securing a **Bronze Medal** with a **Global Rank of 186** among 9,630 entries. This solution stood among the top **10%** of all teams in a highly competitive environment.
